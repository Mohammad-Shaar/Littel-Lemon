### What I learned

In This project I applied all the skills and concepts I had learned so far, And it's include:

- How to use redux toolkit to manage the state of my website and write less code.
- How to use react-router to create dynamic routes and navigate between different pages of my website.
- How to use props to pass data and events between components
- How to use hooks to add state and effects to functional components.
- Hooks also allowed me to create my own custom hook, which was a fun and challenging experience.
- Finally, I built a professional-looking form with basic validation.
